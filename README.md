# Netflix Content Clustering (Unsupervised)

## Netflix Dataset Analysis and Recommendation System

Welcome to the "Netflix Content Clustering and Recommendation System" project, where we delve into the vast world of Netflix's TV shows and movies. Our mission is clear: to cluster content intelligently, unravel deep insights into viewer preferences, and craft a personalized recommendation system. All of this is aimed at elevating user experience and curbing subscriber churn.

Project Overview
1. Data Preparation
 - Handling Null Values: Ensured data integrity by addressing null values.
 - Managing Nested Columns: Processed columns with nested data for better visualization and analysis.
 - Binning Ratings: Categorized ratings for improved analysis and recommendation.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Applied EDA techniques to extract insights and understand patterns, crucial for preventing subscriber churn.
3. Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
 - Creating Clusters: Utilized NLP techniques to cluster content based on diverse attributes.
 - Dimensionality Reduction: Employed PCA to enhance performance and eliminate noise.
4. Clustering Algorithms
 - Implemented K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to create meaningful content clusters.
 - Determined optimal cluster numbers through rigorous evaluation methods.
5. Content-Based Recommender System
 - Developed a content-based recommender system using the cosine similarity matrix.
 - Aimed to provide personalized recommendations, mitigating subscriber churn and enhancing engagement.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis and recommendation system are designed to elevate user satisfaction and reduce subscriber churn for Netflix. By implementing content clustering and a personalized recommendation engine, the project aims to contribute to higher user retention rates.
